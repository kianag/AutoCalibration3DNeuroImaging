# Automatic Calibration of 3D NeuroImaging



## Getting Started

This project is based on automating the 3D miniscope, a smaller project as part of a project being pursued by the 
Waller lab at UC Berkeley. The following [research poster](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yT8DAW1hvgq66UxTl1__hjPdbWzJM2uvW0zNpjevfL0/edit?usp=sharing)
gives a concise summary of the "Automatic Calibration of 3D NeuroImaging" project.

### Prerequisites

Install latest version of [Micro-Manager](https://micro-manager.org/) for your system

Install latest version of [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) for your system
