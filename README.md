# Automatic Calibration of 3D NeuroImaging



## Getting Started

This project is based on automating the 3D miniscope, a smaller project as part of a project being pursued by the 
Waller lab at UC Berkeley. The following [research poster](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yT8DAW1hvgq66UxTl1__hjPdbWzJM2uvW0zNpjevfL0/edit?usp=sharing)
gives a concise summary of the "Automatic Calibration of 3D NeuroImaging" project.

The following [instructional manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OTT_0LJ6XY1uEJGRwLF9KeHkSnfgOSdXvs3AyN3iXWI/edit?usp=sharing) is my documented, step by step work for how to do Automatic Calibration of 3D NeuroImaging.
